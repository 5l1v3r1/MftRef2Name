v1.0.0.2: Fixed bug when $MFT itself contained an $ATTRIBUTE_LIST. Fixed bug with handling records that was split across dataruns. Increased initialization size of array for runs and vcns which caused it to crash with extreme fragmentation.
v1.0.0.1: Added support for MFT record sizes of 4096 bytes.
