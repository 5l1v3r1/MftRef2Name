
v1.0.0.3
Fixed bug that caused only one or the other of $INDEX_ROOT/$INDEX_ALLOCATION to be evaluated for directory content.

v1.0.0.2
Fixed bug when $MFT itself contained an $ATTRIBUTE_LIST. Fixed bug with handling records that was split across dataruns. Increased initialization size of array for runs and vcns which caused it to crash with extreme fragmentation.
